Stack expression utilities

These functions use a "hidden" variable in the calling
code frame context to hold a stack (a Python list)
with values - the simple functionality here allow one
have much of the functionality of stack
based languages, like Postscript and Forth conveninently
available to be used in any Python expression.


(MAYBE) TODO: create a decorator which trasnform the operations here
in real operations in the Python VM stack,
by modifying the bytecode of calls to these utility functions into
actual Python VM stack operations.
